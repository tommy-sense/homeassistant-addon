# TOMMY (Home Assistant Add-on)

This is the Home Assistant add-on for TOMMY, a Wi-Fi motion detection system that turns ESP32 devices into motion sensors capable of detecting movement through walls and obstacles.

The add-on integrates TOMMY directly into your Home Assistant instance, allowing you to create motion zones for use with your existing automations. All processing happens locally on your network.
